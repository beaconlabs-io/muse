## Key Points


## Background



## Analysis Method

### Dataset

The datasets and methods used for the SuperStacks analysis were:

- Period: 76-day incentive period (April 16 – June 30) and a 30-day retention evaluation period after program end (through July 30).
- Data sources: 25 pools and vaults targeted by SuperStacks incentives.
- Metrics:
  - TVL (Total Value Locked): Net TVL inflows during the program and retained inflows after program end.
  - Trading volume: Indicator of demand-side activity in DEX pools.
  - Utilization: Indicator of demand-side activity in lending pools.
  - Cost efficiency: Net TVL inflows per OP token ($/OP).

### Intervation / Explanatory Variable

SuperStacks Program: 

SuperStacks was the Optimism Foundation’s first attempt at a “proactive DeFi incentive,” designed as a pilot program to increase liquidity of interoperable assets across the Superchain. The program was built on a two-pronged approach targeting both supply-side and demand-side activities. Specifically, incentives were provided to encourage supply-side actions (deposits into DEX pools, increased lending supply), which in turn aimed to stimulate demand-side activities (higher trading volume, increased utilization).

### Dependent Variable

Establishing a sustainable DeFi growth loop: Testing a new mechanism for interoperable assets to overcome the cold-start problem and achieve sustained growth.

### Identification Strategy

- A pro-rata model was applied to disentangle the complexity of overlapping incentive programs, attributing impact based on each program’s share of total USD incentives.
- To evaluate pool-level performance, incentivized pools (treatment group) were paired with comparable non-incentivized pools (control group) on the same chain and protocol. One-sided t-tests were conducted on changes in TVL and trading volume.
- The analysis focused on DEX pools (9 pairs) that passed statistical filtering.

### Results
- Theoretical Support: The analysis confirmed the theory that strong demand-side activity raises the equilibrium level after incentives end. The program was designed to test new mechanisms by which interoperable assets on the Superchain could overcome the cold-start problem and establish a sustainable DeFi growth loop.
- Mechanism Validation: The two-pronged approach targeting both supply-side and demand-side activities supported the theoretical framework that sustained liquidity growth of interoperable assets on the Superchain can be promoted. The hypothesis was that incentives would increase TVL (supply side), leading to higher trading volume and utilization (demand side), and ultimately these metrics would settle at higher equilibrium levels even after incentives stopped.
- Challenges: However, more rigorous analysis of this theory is needed. While trading volume per TVL emerged as a potential predictor of net TVL inflows, its explanatory power was inconsistent, requiring further careful analysis.

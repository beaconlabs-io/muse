## Key Points


## Background



## Analysis Method

### Dataset

The datasets and methods used for the SuperStacks analysis were:

- Period: 76-day incentive period (April 16 – June 30) and a 30-day retention evaluation period after program end (through July 30).
- Data sources: 25 pools and vaults targeted by SuperStacks incentives.
- Metrics:
  - TVL (Total Value Locked): Net TVL inflows during the program and retained inflows after program end.
  - Trading volume: Indicator of demand-side activity in DEX pools.
  - Utilization: Indicator of demand-side activity in lending pools.
  - Cost efficiency: Net TVL inflows per OP token ($/OP).

### Intervation / Explanatory Variable

SuperStacks Program: 

SuperStacks was the Optimism Foundation’s first attempt at a “proactive DeFi incentive,” designed as a pilot program to increase liquidity of interoperable assets across the Superchain. The program was built on a two-pronged approach targeting both supply-side and demand-side activities. Specifically, incentives were provided to encourage supply-side actions (deposits into DEX pools, increased lending supply), which in turn aimed to stimulate demand-side activities (higher trading volume, increased utilization).

### Dependent Variable

Trading volume and utilization: Determining whether TVL growth led to higher demand-side trading volume and lending utilization, and whether these metrics remained at elevated equilibrium levels after incentives stopped.

### Identification Strategy

- A pro-rata model was applied to disentangle the complexity of overlapping incentive programs, attributing impact based on each program’s share of total USD incentives.
- To evaluate pool-level performance, incentivized pools (treatment group) were paired with comparable non-incentivized pools (control group) on the same chain and protocol. One-sided t-tests were conducted on changes in TVL and trading volume.
- The analysis focused on DEX pools (9 pairs) that passed statistical filtering.

### Results
- DEX Trading Volume:
  - In DEX pools, trading volume per TVL was used as a measure of liquidity “productivity.”
  - CL100-USD₮0/kBTC on OP Mainnet: Alongside rapid TVL growth, trading volume increased by 126.7% during the program, and remained 42.7% above baseline after incentives ended (p < 0.01).
  - CL1-USD₮0/USDC on OP Mainnet: TVL rose, while trading volume saw a modest 2.5% increase during the program. However, after incentives ended, volume accelerated and stabilized 25.1% above baseline (p < 0.01).
  - BV-WETH/weETH on OP Mainnet: Beyond TVL growth, trading volume rose even more sharply, increasing 123.8% during the program and remaining 49.4% above baseline afterward (p < 0.01).
- Lending Market Utilization:
  - In lending pools, utilization rate was used as the demand-side traction metric.
  - The lending pool with the highest performance at peak net TVL inflow showed a healthy 60.2% utilization rate, but the relationship between supply and demand momentum was less clear than in DEXs. Theoretically, competitive borrowing rates were expected to attract more borrowers, boost utilization, and deliver higher yields to lenders.

# Stage Definitions Reference

Detailed definitions, boundary tests, and examples for each stage in a
Theory of Change logic model.

## Activities

**Definition**: Actions the intervention team directly implements.
These are within the Sphere of Control -- they happen because the
team decides to do them.

**Boundary test**: "Does this stop if the project team stops working?"
If yes, it is an Activity.

**Timeframe**: During active implementation.

**Metrics should measure**: Effort and execution (did we do the work?).

**Good examples**:

- Conduct 12-week teacher training program in formative assessment
- Develop and deploy community health data platform
- Facilitate monthly evidence review workshops for NGO staff

**Bad examples** (these are Outputs, not Activities):

- Training materials created (this is a deliverable, not an action)
- Platform available (this is a completed deliverable)
- Staff trained (this is a completed result, not the activity itself)

## Outputs

**Definition**: Tangible deliverables or completed products that result
directly from Activities. Still within the Sphere of Control --
you can count them and verify they exist.

**Boundary test**: "Can we count or verify this exists regardless of
whether anyone uses it?" If yes, it is an Output.

**Timeframe**: At completion of Activities.

**Metrics should measure**: Delivery and quality (what did we produce?
Does it meet specifications?).

**Good examples**:

- 200 teachers completed the 12-week training program
- Health data platform deployed with 50 community health centers connected
- Evidence library containing 150 curated research summaries published

**Bad examples** (these are Short-term Outcomes, not Outputs):

- Teachers use new assessment methods (this requires behavior change)
- Community health workers regularly enter data (this requires adoption)
- NGO staff reference evidence in proposals (this is behavior change)

## Short-term Outcomes

**Definition**: Initial adoption, behavior change, or knowledge uptake
by the target population. This is where the model crosses from the
Sphere of Control to the Sphere of Influence -- you cannot guarantee
these happen.

**Boundary test**: "Does this require someone outside the project team
to do something differently?" If yes, it is at least a Short-term Outcome.

**Timeframe**: 0-6 months after Outputs are delivered.

**Metrics should measure**: Adoption and initial behavior change
(is the target population using what we delivered? How?).

**Good examples**:

- Trained teachers implement formative assessment in at least one class per week
- Community health workers enter patient data within 48 hours of visits
- NGO program designers access evidence library before drafting new proposals

**Bad examples** (these are Intermediate Outcomes, not Short-term):

- Sustained institutional adoption of evidence-based practices
  (requires persistence over 6+ months -- this is Intermediate)
- School-wide shift to formative assessment culture
  (requires system change, not just individual adoption)
- Health data platform becomes regional standard
  (requires scale beyond initial adopters)

## Intermediate Outcomes

**Definition**: Sustained practice changes and system-level shifts that
emerge when Short-term Outcomes persist over time. Still within the
Sphere of Influence, but further from the intervention's direct control.

**Boundary test**: "Does this require Short-term behavior change to
persist and spread beyond initial adopters?" If yes, it is an
Intermediate Outcome.

**Timeframe**: 6-24 months after initial adoption.

**Metrics should measure**: Sustained practice and system change
(has the change stuck? Has it spread? Are institutional processes
different?).

**Good examples**:

- School leadership integrates formative assessment into official
  teacher evaluation criteria
- District health offices use platform data for resource allocation
  decisions
- Funding agencies require evidence citations in grant applications

**Bad examples** (these are Impacts, not Intermediate Outcomes):

- National education quality transformed (too broad, too many factors)
- Community health disparities eliminated (contribution, not attribution)
- Evidence-based policy becomes the norm across the sector
  (too broad for a single intervention)

## Impact

**Definition**: Long-term, broad-level change that the intervention
contributes to alongside many other factors. This is the Sphere of
Interest -- the intervention can claim contribution but not attribution.

**Boundary test**: "Would claiming sole credit for this be dishonest?"
If yes, it is an Impact.

**Timeframe**: 2+ years, ongoing.

**Metrics should measure**: Broad indicators where the intervention
is one contributor among many (population-level indicators, sector
trends, systemic metrics).

**Good examples**:

- Improved learning outcomes for students in target communities
- Strengthened community health systems in participating districts
- More effective allocation of development resources through
  evidence-informed decision-making

**Bad examples** (overclaiming):

- Global poverty eliminated (no single intervention does this)
- Complete transformation of national education system
  (too broad for most interventions)
- All policy decisions become evidence-based
  (unrealistic and too broad)

| Activity → Output         | Execution → Completion               | What did we deliver?                                                   | Writing Outcomes here (e.g., "teachers trained" vs "training conducted") |
| Output → Short-term       | Delivery → Adoption                  | Who is using this, and how?                                            | Skipping adoption (the single biggest error in logic models)             |
| Short-term → Intermediate | Initial use → Sustained practice     | What institutional or systemic change follows from sustained adoption? | Confusing continued individual use with institutional change             |
| Intermediate → Impact     | Practice change → Broad contribution | Would claiming sole credit be dishonest?                               | Overclaiming (attributing broad change to a single intervention)         |

## Using This Reference

When constructing a logic model, check each card against these definitions:

1. Read the card's title and description.
2. Apply the boundary test for its assigned stage.
3. If the card fails the test, move it to the correct stage.
4. Verify the metrics measure what that stage requires.

If a card seems to span two stages, split it into two cards -- one for
each stage. This is usually a sign that a causal step is being compressed.

## Key Points

In FIL-RetroPGF-2, the scoring rule was changed from the median in Round 1 to the sum. This change made the fund distribution closer to a power-law distribution, increasing the amount of funding received by top projects.

## Background

Within the Filecoin ecosystem, a Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) program has been implemented to provide funding for public goods. FIL-RetroPGF-2 was the second iteration of this program. Based on the results of Round 1, the scoring rules were revised with two objectives: to make the voting mechanism easier to understand, and to ensure that while top projects received substantial funding, a wide range of projects—including those in the long tail—would also benefit.

## Analysis Method

### Dataset

Voting data from badgeholders (voters) in FIL-RetroPGF-2

### Intervation / Explanatory Variable

Scoring rules (sum, median, mean, etc.)

### Dependent Variable

Distribution of funding amounts allocated to each project

### Identification Strategy

The actual fund allocation results using the sum scoring rule in FIL-RetroPGF-2 were compared with simulated counterfactual results under median or mean scoring. In addition, statistical comparisons were made between Round 1 (median) and Round 2 (sum).

## Results

- The sum scoring rule was observed to generate a funding distribution more closely resembling a power-law distribution than the median or mean rules.
- As a result, compared to Round 1, a larger share of funding went to top projects in Round 2.
- This change, together with the shift toward assigning absolute funding amounts rather than percentages by badgeholders, may have contributed to a more exponential distribution of funding.

## Key Points

Most GSoC students did not continue contributing to their projects after the program, but a minority became frequent contributors. Since students mainly participated for enriching (work) experiences rather than to become long-term OSS contributors, this also shaped contribution continuity.

## Background

OSS projects join Summer of Code programs hoping for retention of newcomers and increased code contributions. Previous research focused on students’ quantitative contributions during GSoC or their outcomes. However, the link between motivations for participation and post-program contributions had not been examined. This study investigates students’ motivations for joining GSoC and their intentions/continuation of contributions afterward. Prior research found that experience levels strongly influence retention, that GSoC fosters strong bonds between mentors and students, and that 18% of students later became mentors.

## Analysis Method

### Dataset

- The study targeted students who participated in GSoC between 2010 and 2015. Out of 1000 survey invitations, 141 students responded (14.1% response rate).
- From these, 10 students volunteered for follow-up interviews.

### Intervation / Explanatory Variable

- Participation in GSoC, along with associated experiences and rewards.
- GSoC is a three-month program that provides scholarships and mentorship to students who wish to contribute to open source software (OSS) projects.

### Dependent Variable

- Students’ intent to continue contributing and changes in contribution frequency before/after GSoC.

### Identification Strategy

- Data was collected via survey questions (OSS contributions before/after GSoC, general participation reasons).
- Descriptive statistics were applied. Results were also compared with prior quantitative research (Silva et al., 2017).

### Results

- Pre-GSoC Contributions: 56.0% had “Never” contributed to their chosen project before GSoC, and 13.5% said “Rarely.” For OSS projects outside GSoC, 34.7% said “Never” and 32.6% “Rarely.”
- Intent to Continue: About 57% intended to continue contributing (“Yes” or “Definitely yes”).
- Actual Continuation: Post-GSoC contributions were reported as: “No” 17.0%, “Rarely” 21.3%, “Occasionally” 32.6%, “Frequently” 12.8%, “Core member” 16.3%.
- Change in Contribution Frequency: About 53% (75 students) reported increased contribution frequency after GSoC. However, prior quantitative research (Silva et al., 2017) showed only ~16% continued contributing after several months, consistent with this study’s findings. This aligns with Roberts et al. (2006), suggesting initial motivations don’t always translate to long-term retention.
- Frequent Contributors: Both this and prior studies indicated a small subset of students became frequent developers.

Link to Motivations: While stipends were important, experienced developers saw them as essential. Less experienced students emphasized career building as the main reason for joining.

## Key Points

- Administrators generally make more edits across all namespaces, but the post-meeting increase in activity is smaller than for other users.
- Administrators who had been inactive are more likely to resume editing after meetings, but their subsequent increase in activity is not as large as that of other users.

## Background

Prior research suggests that meetings are essential to administrative decision-making and that users who become administrators may increase their activity after participating. This study examines how the administrator role influences contribution behavior following meetings.

## Analysis Method

### Dataset

- We combine a comprehensive dataset on informal offline meetings in the German-language Wikipedia community from 2001 to 2020 with large-scale online activity data.
- The dataset includes information on 4,408 small-scale meetings and 4,013 participating users.
- All online actions on Wikipedia are recorded, and users’ editing activities are measured from metadata dumps.
- Information on whether a user has ever become a Wikipedia administrator is also included.

### Intervation / Explanatory Variable

- In addition to participation in offline meetings, we consider whether the user is an administrator.
- The models include an indicator for administrator status and its interaction terms.

### Dependent Variable

- Outcome variables are the volume of users’ editing activity (number of edits) and the presence/absence of editing, analyzed over short, medium, and long horizons.

### Identification Strategy

- We use a quasi-experimental design (DiD, matching, multilevel LPM, multilevel negative binomial models), incorporating triple interaction terms to assess how administrator status moderates meeting effects.

### Results

- Users who are administrators tend to make more edits across all namespaces regardless of meeting participation.
- However, after attending a meeting, administrators show smaller increases in activity compared to other users. This likely reflects a ceiling effect: administrators already have high baseline activity, leaving less room for additional increases from meetings.
- In the medium-term (1 month) models, inactive administrators are more likely to resume editing after meetings; yet, as in the short-term models, their subsequent increase in activity is smaller than for other users. A similar negative moderating effect of administrator status appears in the long-term (1 year) trends.
